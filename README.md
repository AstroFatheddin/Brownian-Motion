Simulating Brownian Motion and Entropy of the system
Brownian motion, or pedesis, is the random motion of particles suspended in a medium. This pattern of motion typically consists of random fluctuations in a particle's position inside a fluid sub-domain, followed by a relocation to another sub-domain [WikiPedia].
